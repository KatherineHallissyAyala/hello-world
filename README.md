# hello-world
I am refreshing my programming skills after focusing on my job as a mom for nine years.  I have prior expierience with C, Java, LISP, SQL, and HTML/CSS, and I have studied JavaScript and React.  My first language was Pascal!  As a computer teacher, I taught Logo to third graders.  I am planning to collaborate on programming projects from home, and I hope to one day work in the field of artificial intelligence.
