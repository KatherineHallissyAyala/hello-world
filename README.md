# hello-world
I am learning to use GitHub.  I am refreshing my programming skills after focusing on my job as a mom for nine years.  I know JavaScript, SQL, and HTML/CSS.  My first language was Pascal!  I am planning to collaborate on programming projects from home, and I hope to one day work in the field of artificial intelligence.
